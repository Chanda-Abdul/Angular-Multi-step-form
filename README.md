### Useful resources

- [Material Button toggle](https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle/overview) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. `<mat-button-toggle>` are on/off toggles with the appearance of a button. 
- [Material Checkbox](https://material.angular.io/components/checkbox/overview) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.`<mat-checkbox>` provides the same functionality as a native `<input type="checkbox">` enhanced with Material Design styling and animations.
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
